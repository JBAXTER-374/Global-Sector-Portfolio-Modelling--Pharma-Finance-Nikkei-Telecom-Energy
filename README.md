Purpose and Aims of the Research:

This research investigates the risk–return trade-offs, volatility characteristics, and market sensitivities of selected stocks and indices, focusing on Merck & Co. (MRK), Morgan Stanley (MS), Vodafone, SSE, and the Nikkei 225 index.

The research aims to investigate:

- A comparison of defensive healthcare stocks with cyclical financial stocks.
- Assess volatility clustering, stationarity, and risk-return profiles.
- Identify key drivers of market movements within the Nikkei 225 using principal component analysis (PCA).
- Evaluate inter-stock relationships via regression analysis.
- Draw portfolio insights relevant to diversification, risk management, and market resilience.


Introduction:

Financial markets are subject to sector-specific risks, macroeconomic pressures, and external shocks such as COVID-19, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. This study applies econometric and financial models to:

- Examine stock price behaviour, return distributions, and volatility patterns.
- Test the stationarity of returns and their predictive properties.
- Analyse systemic influences within the Nikkei 225 index.
- Explore cross-relationships between European stocks (Vodafone and SSE).

The findings provide investors with a clearer understanding of sectoral sensitivities, portfolio construction strategies, and the limitations of predictive modelling in financial markets.


Findings:

1.Descriptive Statistics:
 - MS (Morgan Stanley): Higher mean daily returns (0.000879) but greater volatility (σ = 0.0213). Large range (−0.1696 to 0.1804) showing a higher upside potential but also higher downside risk. 
- MRK (Merck & Co.): Lower mean returns (0.000325) and lower volatility (σ = 0.0144). Narrower distribution → more stable, defensive behaviour.


2. Return Distributions:   
- MS: Bell-shaped but with thick tails, indicating a higher probability of extreme outcomes. Boxplot shows frequent outliers.
- MRK: Near-normal with thinner tails, few outliers, and tighter interquartile range (IQR).

3. Stationarity (ADF Test)
- Null hypothesis rejected for both MRK and MS returns.
- Daily returns are stationary, oscillating around a constant mean with no unit root.
- Confirms unpredictability of long-term returns which supports Efficient Market Hypothesis.

4. Nikkei 225: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- PC1: Captures largest share of variance in daily returns.
- High-loading stocks: SoftBank Group (9984.T), Tokyo Electron (8035.T) are more volatile, drive index movements
- Low-loading stocks: NTT (9432.T), KDDI (9433.T) are more stable, weakly correlated with index, offering diversification benefits.


5. Portfolio and Sector Performance
- Weighted Portfolio (2019–2024): Tracks Nikkei 225 closely but diverges during crises (COVID-19, late 2024).
- Sector insights: Telecoms and consumer staples (NTT, KDDI, Suntory) are stable. Financials and technology (SoftBank, Tokyo Electron) are more cyclical and have higher exposure to shocks.


6. Regression Model (Vodafone vs. SSE)
- OLS Results: SSE returns significantly predict Vodafone’s returns (β = 0.337, p < 0.001).
- Weak explanatory power: R² = 0.065 - Vodafone’s performance mostly driven by other market factors.
- Diagnostics:
   - Residuals non-normal (Jarque-Bera test, p < 0.001).
   - Heteroscedasticity present (Breusch-Pagan test, p < 0.001).
   - No autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson ≈ 2.05).
     
7. Residual Analysis
- Violations: Normality and Homoscedasticity.
- Met assumptions: Linearity and No Autocorrelation.
- Implication: Relationship exists but inference reliability is limited.


Significance

1.	Risk–Return Trade-Off:
- MS offers higher returns but greater volatility more attractive for risk-tolerant investors.
- MRK provides steady, defensive performance.
  
2.	Volatility Clustering:
- MS more sensitive to macro shocks (COVID-19 crash, 2022–23 inflationary pressures).
- MRK stable but affected by sector-specific factors (drug sales, earnings guidance).

3. Index Dynamics:
- High-loading technology and financials drive volatility in the Nikkei 225.
- Low-loading telecoms provide diversification and stability.
  
4. Cross-Stock Relationships:
- Vodafone and SSE moderately correlated - weak but positive link.
- Regression confirms influence but low explanatory power, highlighting industry-specific drivers.
  
6.	Investment Implications:
- Defensive stocks and telecoms mitigate volatility in portfolios.
- Cyclical and high-loading stocks provide growth but increase systemic risk.
- Diversification across sectors and geographies is essential during crises.
