Purpose and Aims of the Research:

This research investigates the risk–return trade-offs, volatility characteristics, and market sensitivities of selected stocks and indices, focusing on Merck & Co. (MRK), Morgan Stanley (MS), Vodafone, SSE, and the Nikkei 225 index.

The resaech investigates are to:
•	A comparison of defensive healthcare stocks with cyclical financial stocks.
•	Assess volatility clustering, stationarity, and risk-return profiles.
•	Identify key drivers of market movements within the Nikkei 225 using principal component analysis (PCA).
•	Evaluate inter-stock relationships via regression analysis.
•	Draw portfolio insights relevant to diversification, risk management, and market resilience.


Introduction:

Financial markets are subject to sector-specific risks, macroeconomic pressures, and external shocks such as COVID-19, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions. This study applies econometric and financial models to:
•	Examine stock price behaviour, return distributions, and volatility patterns.
•	Test the stationarity of returns and their predictive properties.
•	Analyse systemic influences within the Nikkei 225 index.
•	Explore cross-relationships between European stocks (Vodafone and SSE).
The findings provide investors with a clearer understanding of sectoral sensitivities, portfolio construction strategies, and the limitations of predictive modelling in financial markets.


Findings:

1. Descriptive Statistics:
   
- MS (Morgan Stanley): Higher mean daily returns (0.000879) but greater volatility (σ = 0.0213). Large range (−0.1696 to 0.1804) → higher upside potential but also higher downside risk.
•	MRK (Merck & Co.): Lower mean returns (0.000325) and lower volatility (σ = 0.0144). Narrower distribution → more stable, defensive behaviour.

2. Return Distributions:
   
- MS: Bell-shaped but with thick tails, indicating a higher probability of extreme outcomes. Boxplot shows frequent outliers.
- MRK: Near-normal with thinner tails, few outliers, and tighter interquartile range (IQR).

2. Stationarity (ADF Test)
•	Null hypothesis rejected for both MRK and MS returns.
•	Daily returns are stationary, oscillating around a constant mean with no unit root.
•	Confirms unpredictability of long-term returns → supports Efficient Market Hypothesis.

3. Nikkei 225: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
•	PC1: Captures largest share of variance in daily returns.
•	High-loading stocks: SoftBank Group (9984.T), Tokyo Electron (8035.T) → volatile, drive index movements.
•	Low-loading stocks: NTT (9432.T), KDDI (9433.T) → stable, weakly correlated with index, offering diversification benefits.


4. Portfolio and Sector Performance
•	Weighted Portfolio (2019–2024): Tracks Nikkei 225 closely but diverges during crises (COVID-19, late 2024).
•	Sector insights: Telecoms and consumer staples (NTT, KDDI, Suntory) → stability. Financials and technology (SoftBank, Tokyo Electron) → higher cyclicality and exposure to shocks.


5. Regression Model (Vodafone vs. SSE)
•	OLS Results: SSE returns significantly predict Vodafone’s returns (β = 0.337, p < 0.001).
•	Weak explanatory power: R² = 0.065 → Vodafone’s performance mostly driven by other market factors.
•	Diagnostics:
o	Residuals non-normal (Jarque-Bera test, p < 0.001).
o	Heteroscedasticity present (Breusch-Pagan test, p < 0.001).
o	No autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson ≈ 2.05).
3.7 Residual Analysis
•	Violations: Normality and Homoscedasticity.
•	Met assumptions: Linearity and No Autocorrelation.
•	Implication: Relationship exists but inference reliability is limited.


Significance of the Data:
1.	Risk–Return Trade-Off:
o	MS offers higher returns but greater volatility → attractive for risk-tolerant investors.
o	MRK provides steady, defensive performance.
2.	Volatility Clustering:
o	MS more sensitive to macro shocks (COVID-19 crash, 2022–23 inflationary pressures).
o	MRK stable but affected by sector-specific factors (drug sales, earnings guidance).
3.	Index Dynamics:
o	High-loading technology and financials drive volatility in the Nikkei 225.
o	Low-loading telecoms provide diversification and stability.
4.	Cross-Stock Relationships:
o	Vodafone and SSE moderately correlated → weak but positive link.
o	Regression confirms influence but low explanatory power, highlighting industry-specific drivers.
5.	Investment Implications:
o	Defensive stocks and telecoms mitigate volatility in portfolios.
o	Cyclical and high-loading stocks provide growth but increase systemic risk.
o	Diversification across sectors and geographies is essential during crises.
